In Canada, WHMIS legislation requires that products used in the workplace that meet the criteria to be classified as hazardous products must be labelled. Labels are the first alert to the user about the major hazards associated with that product, and outline the basic precautions or safety steps that should be taken. The hazardous products Saftey Data Sheet will contain more information.",

It is a comprehensive plan for providing information on the safe use of hazardous materials used in Canadian workplaces. Information is provided by means of product labels, safety data sheets (SDS) and worker education programs. The main components of WHMIS are hazard identification and product classification, labelling, material safety data sheets, and worker training and education. SDS's are required to be accurate at the time of sale. An SDS will be required to be updated when the supplier becomes aware of any significant new data. SDS's will be required to be updated within 90 days of the supplier being aware of the new information. If you purchase a product within this 90 day time period, the supplier must inform you of the significant new data and the date on which it became available in writing. The requirement to update a material safety data sheet every three years, as was the case under WHMIS 1988, no longer applies. For WHMIS 2015, the SDS must be accurate at the time of every sale or importation of the hazardous product. Suppliers have an ongoing responsibility to make sure SDSs and labels are accurate and compliant.",
